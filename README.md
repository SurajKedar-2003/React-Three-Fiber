## Introduction

**React Three Fiber** is a React renderer for Three.js that makes it easier to work with WebGL and create 3D experiences in a React environment. In this repository, Iâ€™ve implemented some of the core features and concepts of React Three Fiber, such as setting up a basic 3D scene, adding meshes, materials, and lighting.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Three Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js for building 3D content in React.
